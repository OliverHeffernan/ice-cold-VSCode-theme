# Ice Cold VS Code Theme
## Description
A dark theme for Visual Studio Code, a dark deep slate blue background, and blue tones on the text. It creates a blue vibe without sacrificing readability of code. There are certain things that are not blue, this enhances readability. An example of this is string, which are highlighted in an orane colour as this is standard for other themes.
